# Trip Organizer: DevOps and Automation Tasks

This document outlines the necessary DevOps practices to automate the build, testing, and deployment of the Trip Organizer application. The goal is to establish a robust CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline, containerize the application, and deploy it to a suitable cloud environment.

**Note:** GitHub Pages is designed for static websites and cannot host a dynamic backend like an ASP.NET Core Web API or a PostgreSQL database. Therefore, this plan involves deploying the React frontend to GitHub Pages and the backend API and database to a cloud provider like Azure.

### Phase 3: Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **Task 3.1: Create a CI Workflow for the Backend** ✅

  - ✅ Develop a GitHub Actions workflow file (`backend-ci.yml`) that triggers on every push and pull request to the main branch.
  - The workflow:
    - [x] ✅ Set up the .NET 8.0 SDK.
    - [x] ✅ Restore dependencies.
    - [x] ✅ Build the ASP.NET Core Web API project.
    - [x] ✅ Run unit and integration tests.
    - [x] ✅ **ENHANCED**: Added comprehensive test suite with code coverage reporting
    - [x] ✅ **ENHANCED**: Added backend test project with xUnit, Moq, FluentAssertions

- [x] **Task 3.2: Create a CI Workflow for the Frontend** ✅

  - ✅ Create a GitHub Actions workflow file (`frontend-ci.yml`) that triggers on pushes and pull requests to the main branch.
  - The workflow:
    - [x] ✅ Set up Node.js 18+.
    - [x] ✅ Install frontend dependencies using `npm install`.
    - [x] ✅ Build the React.js application.
    - [x] ✅ Run frontend tests.
    - [x] ✅ **ENHANCED**: Added TypeScript checking, security auditing, comprehensive testing
    - [x] ✅ **ENHANCED**: Added React component tests with Testing Library

- [x] **Task 3.3: Create Complete CI/CD Pipeline** ✅ (Additional)
  - ✅ **DELIVERABLE**: Created `ci-cd-pipeline.yml` for end-to-end automation
  - ✅ **DELIVERABLE**: Added integration testing between frontend and backend
  - ✅ **DELIVERABLE**: Enhanced test automation and reporting

### Phase 4: Containerization with Docker ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **Task 4.1: Dockerize the ASP.NET Core Backend** ✅

  - ✅ Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of the `TripOrganizer.API` project to containerize the backend application.
  - ✅ **BONUS**: Enhanced existing Dockerfile with security best practices (non-root user, optimized layers)
  - ✅ **DELIVERABLE**: Created `.dockerignore` for optimized builds

- [x] **Task 4.2: Set Up Docker Compose for Local Development** ✅
  - ✅ Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the repository root to define the services for the backend API and the PostgreSQL database for easy local setup.
  - ✅ **BONUS**: Created comprehensive Docker setup with multiple configurations:
    - `docker-compose.yml` - Base configuration
    - `docker-compose.override.yml` - Development overrides
    - `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production configuration
    - `Dockerfile.dev` - Frontend development container
    - `nginx.conf` - Production web server configuration
  - ✅ **DELIVERABLE**: Created `docker-helper.sh` script for easy container management
  - ✅ **DELIVERABLE**: Created `.env.example` for environment configuration
  - ✅ **DELIVERABLE**: Created comprehensive `DOCKER.md` documentation

### Phase 5: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- [ ] **Task 5.1: Define Cloud Infrastructure with Bicep/Terraform**
  - Choose an IaC tool (e.g., Azure Bicep or Terraform) to script the cloud infrastructure.
  - Create scripts to provision:
    - [ ] Azure App Service Plan and App Service for the backend API.
    - [ ] Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance.
    - [ ] Necessary networking and security configurations.
  - Store the IaC files in a dedicated `infrastructure` directory.

### Phase 6: Continuous Deployment (CD) with GitHub Actions ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETED

- [x] **Task 6.1: Deploy the React Frontend to GitHub Pages** ✅

  - ✅ Enhance the `frontend-ci.yml` workflow to add a deployment job.
  - ✅ The job builds the React app for production and deploy the static output to GitHub Pages.
  - ✅ **DELIVERABLES**:
    - `frontend-deploy.yml` - Complete GitHub Pages deployment workflow
    - Updated `package.json` with homepage configuration
    - Updated `App.tsx` with basename for proper routing
    - `GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md` - Complete deployment setup guide
    - `.env.production.example` - Production environment template

- [ ] **Task 6.2: Deploy the Backend API to Azure App Service**

  - Create a new workflow file (`backend-cd.yml`) that triggers on a push to the main branch.
  - The workflow should:
    - [ ] Log in to Azure using a service principal.
    - [ ] Build and publish the ASP.NET Core application.
    - [ ] Deploy the published artifacts to the Azure App Service.

- [ ] **Task 6.3: Automate Database Migrations**

  - Add a step to the `backend-cd.yml` workflow to apply Entity Framework Core migrations to the Azure PostgreSQL database after a successful API deployment.

- [ ] **Task 6.4: Securely Manage Secrets and Connection Strings**
  - Store all sensitive information (Azure credentials, database connection strings) as encrypted secrets in the GitHub repository settings.
  - Reference these secrets in the deployment workflows.

### Phase 7: Security and Monitoring

- [ ] **Task 7.1: Integrate Security Scanning**

  - Add a security scanning step to your CI workflows using a tool like GitHub CodeQL to analyze code for vulnerabilities.

- [ ] **Task 7.2: Set Up Logging and Monitoring in Azure**

### Phase 8: Documentation

- [ ] **Task 8.1: Document the CI/CD Pipeline**
  - Update the `README.md` or create a new `DEPLOYMENT.md` file to document the CI/CD pipeline, including how workflows are triggered and how to troubleshoot them.
